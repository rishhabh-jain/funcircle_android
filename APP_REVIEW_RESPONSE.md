# App Store Review Response

## Issue 1: Privacy - Data Collection and Storage (Guideline 5.1.1)

We have updated all privacy purpose strings with specific examples:

**Location:** Used to show nearby courts and game requests within 5km on the map, filter venues by distance, and connect with nearby players. Only used while app is open.

**Camera:** Used to take/upload profile photos during setup, capture game photos to share in chat, and update profile pictures from settings.

**Photo Library:** Used to select photos for profile setup/updates, share photos with playing partners in chat, and view venue images.

All permissions include specific use cases and user control statements as required.

## Issue 3: In-App Purchases (Guideline 2.1)

**Fun Circle does not have any in-app purchases.**

The app is completely free with no subscriptions, consumables, or paid features. All functionality (finding players, venue discovery, chat, game creation) is accessible to all users without payment.

Note: A previous version had RevenueCat integration for potential future features, but this has been completely removed. You may see commented-out code (main.dart lines 22-23, 46-53, 106-107) but it is disabled and non-functional.

Current version: No monetization implemented. All features are free.

We apologize for any confusion. There are no in-app purchases to review.
